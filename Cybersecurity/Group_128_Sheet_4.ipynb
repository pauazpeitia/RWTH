    "This awesome visualization shows the benefits of using asymmetric cryptography when communicating with a lot of different parties. You can see that it quickly becomes a lot of keys that are needed for symmetric cryptography as each and every pair of communicating partners need their own key. In the case of asymmetric cryptography, the number of keys is equal to the number of parties and grows linearly. Therefore, an advantage of asymmetric cryptography is obviously that we only need to distribute the public key of a party to be able to securely communicate with that party instead of agreeing or exchanging a new key with each party.\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem that remains is: how do we distribute those public keys in an authentic way? If someone would be able to place distribute his public key instead of the correct one, the attacker would be able to perform a person in the middle/man in the middle attack.\n",
    "Here, certificates come into play! Certificates can help to distribute public keys in an authentic way. A so called certification authority creates a certificate that links the identity and the public key. To accomplish this, a digital signature of the certification authority guarantees the correctness of the certificate.\n",

Instead, we would have liked exercise 3 being more like exercise 2, with maybe some coding tasks, but then more text-based/written tasks to compensate for the lesser amount of coding tasks."
