## Abstract

In recent years, new and increasingly efficient strategies for acquiring 3D data have emerged, the ability to efficiently process and analyze 3D geometric data has become crucial for applications ranging from autonomous driving to medical imaging. Traditional methods have often relied on converting 3D data into voxel grids or image collections, introducing quantization artifacts and computational overhead. This paper reviews PointNet, a deep learning architecture that consumes raw, unordered point clouds directly. The theoretical foundation in permutation invariance is analyzed, specifically its relation to the DeepSets framework, along with an explanation of how symmetric functions are used to approximate global shape features. Furthermore, PointNet is compared with hierarchical approaches and modern Transformer-based methods, followed by a discussion of its lasting impact as a milestone in 3D computer vision.
